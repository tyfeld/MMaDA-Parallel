His head will follow the rotation of his shoulders, ensuring the movement looks fluid and not forced.\n\nIn the resulting answer image, his gaze should still be directed forward but with a slight shift in his overall orientation. The other individuals in the scene remain unchanged, keeping the focus on the man's subtle repositioning.

The task requires transforming this expression into an angry one, which typically involves furrowing the brows, tightening the mouth, and adding a glare. \n\nIn the context of the cartoon style, these changes should be exaggerated for clarity. The character's eyes need to narrow with sharp lines above them to indicate anger. The eyebrows should arch downward, creating a more intense look. The mouth should transform from its current relaxed state to a firm line or a slight downturn, emphasizing displeasure. Additionally, the cheeks could puff out slightly to enhance the angry demeanor.\n\nConsidering the classroom setting and the Korean text at the top, which translates to \"I was taking an English test,\" the angry expression will likely convey frustration or annoyance related to the exam situation.

This requires adjusting the camera angle to capture a full-body stance, potentially from a slightly lower vantage point to emphasize the figure's height. The background elements, such as the digital interface and the blue lighting effects, should remain consistent but appear smaller due to the zoomed-out perspective.

The small dog from the original image remains, maintaining continuity.

In the question image, we see a person holding a snow blower, but it appears idle with no visible snow being cleared. To achieve the user's request, the scene needs to transition from a static state to active snow removal. \n\nTo accomplish this, I'll consider adding motion effects such as snow particles flying off the blower's chute and noticeable changes in the snow-covered ground. The path in front of the person should have visible cleared areas, showing the snow blower’s progress. Additionally, the machine itself should appear more engaged, perhaps with its engine visibly running. The person operating the blower may also need slight adjustments in posture to suggest active operation. \n\nBy incorporating these elements, the resulting image will clearly depict the snow blower in use, aligning with the user's intent.", "answer_image": "/data01/yjf/MMaDA-Parallel-yjf/MMaDA-Parallel-A/pre_token/ti2ti/ti2ti_hf_parquet_vae_code-512/files/6769_1.pkl", "answer_thinking": "", "id": 6769, "len": 1024}

In the current image, the box is slightly farther away from the viewer, with the monkeys reaching for the apples. The goal is to bring the box closer, making it more prominent and detailed. \n\nTo achieve this, I'll focus on the perspective and scale. The monkeys' hands should be more visible as they interact with the apples, emphasizing the action. The person holding the box will need to be repositioned slightly, with their arms appearing larger and more dominant in the foreground. Additionally, the background elements, such as the temple structure and other monkeys, should appear smaller due to the change in perspective. The box itself should fill more of the frame, showcasing the vibrant red apples more clearly.

The headset microphone should move in alignment with this new head position. His body posture and hand placement on the laptop remain unchanged, maintaining the professional setting of what appears to be a video call or presentation.

The individual has their arms extended outward with palms facing forward, suggesting a welcoming or excited gesture. The shrug position typically involves raising the shoulders slightly while keeping the arms bent at the elbows and hands near the chest area. \n\nIn the context of the snowy landscape and the helicopter in the background, maintaining the same setting is crucial for continuity. The person's attire and stance should still convey enthusiasm but in a more subtle way, aligning with the shrugging gesture. To achieve this, I'll adjust the arm angles so that the elbows are closer to the body, and the hands are positioned near the chest. The shoulders will need slight elevation to emphasize the shrug. Additionally, ensuring the person’s facial expression remains neutral or slightly curious will complement the shrugging pose effectively.

This suggests a transition from a resting state to a more active one. To achieve this, I'll focus on animating the ducks' bodies, adjusting their legs and necks to simulate standing up.
