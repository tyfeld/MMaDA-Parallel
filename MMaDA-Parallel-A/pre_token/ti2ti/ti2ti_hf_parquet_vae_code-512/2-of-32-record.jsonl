This change will give the impression that they have joined the game. Secondly, the body language should shift from a synchronized pose to more dynamic, individual movements. For instance, some individuals could be bending forward, reaching out, or turning their bodies in anticipation of catching the frisbee. This adjustment will reflect their involvement in the game.\n\nLastly, the setting needs to emphasize the casual and fun atmosphere typical of a frisbee game.

The middle and upper sections will follow suit, becoming less defined and eventually collapsing onto the base. The hat will likely remain on top but may tilt as the supporting structure weakens. To achieve this effect, I'll adjust the snowman’s proportions, making them less rounded and more elongated horizontally.
