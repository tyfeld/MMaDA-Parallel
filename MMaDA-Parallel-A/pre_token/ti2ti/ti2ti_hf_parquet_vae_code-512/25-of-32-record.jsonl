The bear has a relaxed pose, so lifting the arm should create a natural, slightly asymmetrical look. The arm should be bent at the elbow, with the paw raised to about chest level. The surrounding forest environment remains unchanged, keeping the focus on the bear's movement. While adjusting the arm, I'll ensure the bear maintains a friendly demeanor, as it currently holds a small bird in its right hand.

This adjustment will make the child appear more engaged and responsive to the situation. \n\nTo create the desired effect, I’ll also consider the child's facial expression.

This will create the impression that the alien is indeed standing next to rather than in front of the door. Next, I should consider the background and lighting. Since the current setting includes a yellow wall and brown doorframe, these elements should remain consistent to maintain continuity. \n\nAdditionally, to enhance the scene, I might open the door partially or fully, as seen in the ground truth image. This could provide a glimpse of the green grass outside, adding depth and interest to the composition.

In the original image, all performers have both arms raised above their heads, with their bodies facing forward. To align with the instructions, I'll need to adjust their arm positions so that only the right arm is raised. \n\nNext, I'll rotate each performer slightly to face their left side. This will involve shifting their bodies in a way that maintains the group's overall formation but changes their orientation. The performers' skirts and upper body postures will need to be adjusted accordingly to reflect the new stance. Additionally, the background elements, such as the painted scenery and banners, should remain unchanged to preserve the setting’s continuity. \n\nThe resulting image should show the performers with their right arms raised and their bodies turned to the left, creating a synchronized pose that matches the intended action described in the question.", "answer_image": "/data01/yjf/MMaDA-Parallel-yjf/MMaDA-Parallel-A/pre_token/ti2ti/ti2ti_hf_parquet_vae_code-512/files/6284_1.pkl", "answer_thinking": "", "id": 6284, "len": 1024}

The instruction specifies a clockwise rotation, implying that the car needs to be repositioned so that its front right side becomes more prominent, as seen in the answer image.\n\nConsidering the platform's reflective surface and the blue background, maintaining these elements consistent will ensure coherence between the images. The answer image shows the car rotated approximately 90 degrees, with the front right side now facing forward. To achieve this, I need to rotate the car model on its platform, ensuring the wheels and body align accordingly. The reflection on the platform should adjust naturally with the change in the car's position, preserving the mirror-like effect.

To achieve the desired effect, I need to focus on the interaction between the carrot and the character’s hand. \n\nIn the answer image, the carrot needs to be positioned closer to the character’s hand, which should be reaching out to grab it. The fingers should be slightly curled as if in motion to grasp the carrot. The positioning of the carrot should align naturally with the hand's reach, ensuring a realistic interaction. The lighting and shadows should adjust accordingly to emphasize the hand's movement and the proximity of the carrot.

To create the zoomed-in effect, I'll need to enlarge this section slightly, ensuring that the bus and tracks become more dominant within the frame. The buildings and other features should still be visible but occupy less space compared to the original image.\n\nAdditionally, I'll consider adjusting the perspective slightly, so the viewer feels closer to the scene. This may involve cropping out some of the peripheral areas to maintain focus on the core elements. The overall balance of colors and lighting should remain consistent to preserve the aesthetic continuity.\n\nWhen describing the final image, I'll emphasize the increased prominence of the yellow bus and tracks, along with the enhanced clarity of nearby details like the road markings and building facades.

Additionally, the character's head should remain at its current angle to maintain continuity in their gaze direction. The surrounding environment, including the burning wreckage and debris, should stay consistent to preserve the scene's context.

The background should show a calm river or lake surrounded by dense forest, creating a serene outdoor setting. The individual should appear relaxed yet engaged, likely gesturing or speaking to the camera. The lighting should be natural, suggesting daytime with clear skies.

To determine if the cyclist has moved further, I'll consider the distance and position relative to the rider ahead. \n\nIn the answer image, the scene should show the cyclist having advanced along the trail. This means the rider ahead appears closer or more centered in the frame compared to the initial image. The snowy terrain remains consistent but now shows slight changes in the trail's curvature and surrounding vegetation. The cyclist's handlebars may have shifted slightly, suggesting forward momentum.
