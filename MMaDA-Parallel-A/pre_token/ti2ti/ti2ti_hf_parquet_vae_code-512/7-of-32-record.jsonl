This change aligns with the idea of continuing the performance despite the microphone issue. \n\nTo achieve this transformation, the microphone and vocal elements from the original image should be removed, and the performer should be depicted holding and playing a guitar. The background can be adjusted to suggest a more intimate venue with an audience, enhancing the musical atmosphere.

It should appear near the flowers, actively engaging with them in a manner that suggests nibbling. The rabbit could be white or light-colored to contrast with the greenery and flowers, making it stand out. Additionally, the rabbit’s posture should convey curiosity and mischief, perhaps with its ears perked up and its mouth close to a flower. To enhance the narrative, the rabbit may cast a small shadow on the grass, grounding it within the scene.

To answer this, we need to consider the typical reaction in a soccer match when a goal is scored. \n\nWhen a ball hits the back of the net, the goalkeeper often reacts by raising their arms in either disappointment or acknowledgment of the goal. The surrounding players may also react, some celebrating if they are on the scoring team and others showing frustration if they are not. \n\nTo transform the question image into the desired outcome, we need to add elements that depict these reactions. This includes placing a goalkeeper in front of the net with their arms raised, as seen in the answer image. The goalkeeper’s uniform should be visible, along with the number on their jersey. Additionally, other players in various colored jerseys should be added around the goal area, some with their hands on their heads or in celebratory gestures. The background should maintain the stadium setting, complete with spectators and field markings. This setup will effectively illustrate the immediate aftermath of a goal being scored.", "answer_image": "/data01/yjf/MMaDA-Parallel-yjf/MMaDA-Parallel-A/pre_token/ti2ti/ti2ti_hf_parquet_vae_code-512/files/1933_1.pkl", "answer_thinking": "", "id": 1933, "len": 1024}

In the current image, the seedling has just sprouted with a small set of leaves emerging from the soil. As it grows, the plant will develop larger leaves and a more robust stem structure. \n\nTo visualize this, I'll focus on enhancing the size and detail of the seedling. The new image should show a taller stem with additional leaves, indicating further development. The soil surrounding the seedling may appear slightly disturbed due to root expansion. The overall composition should remain similar, maintaining the circular container and the rich brown soil, but with a noticeable increase in the plant's size and complexity. This transformation will illustrate the expected changes as the seedling matures, aligning with the user's intent to understand its growth pattern.", "answer_image": "/data01/yjf/MMaDA-Parallel-yjf/MMaDA-Parallel-A/pre_token/ti2ti/ti2ti_hf_parquet_vae_code-512/files/1934_1.pkl", "answer_thinking": "", "id": 1934, "len": 1024}
{"system_prompt": "Generate an image applying the following editing instruction based on the original image.", "user_prompt": "What will happen when the fruit ripens further?", "user_image": "/data01/yjf/MMaDA-Parallel-yjf/MMaDA-Parallel-A/pre_token/ti2ti/ti2ti_hf_parquet_vae_code-512/files/1935_0.pkl", "answer_text": "To address the question, I observe the current state of the fruit in the question image. The fruits appear ripe but not fully mature, as indicated by their greenish-yellow hue with hints of red. The question asks what will happen if the fruit ripens further. \n\nConsidering the natural ripening process, the fruits should develop richer colors and become more visually appealing. The green areas will likely transition to a deeper red, indicating peak ripeness. Additionally, the texture may change slightly, becoming glossier and more vibrant. \n\nLooking at the answer image, we see the fruits have indeed ripened further. They now display a striking gradient of red and yellow, with the green almost entirely fading away. Some fruits exhibit a slight sheen, suggesting increased juiciness. The surrounding foliage remains similar, maintaining continuity with the original setting. \n\nTo transform the question image into the answer image, I would focus on enhancing the color saturation and brightness of the fruits, particularly emphasizing the red tones while reducing the green. Adding a subtle shine to the fruits' surfaces could also enhance the perception of ripeness. The bird and other elements would remain unchanged to preserve the scene’s context. This approach aligns with the natural progression of fruit ripening and fulfills the user's query.", "answer_image": "/data01/yjf/MMaDA-Parallel-yjf/MMaDA-Parallel-A/pre_token/ti2ti/ti2ti_hf_parquet_vae_code-512/files/1935_1.pkl", "answer_thinking": "", "id": 1935, "len": 1024}
