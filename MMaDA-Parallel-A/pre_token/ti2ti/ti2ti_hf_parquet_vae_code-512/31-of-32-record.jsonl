To achieve this, I need to adjust the arm's position from its current relaxed state to a raised posture. This adjustment should maintain the natural flow of the character's body, ensuring the movement looks fluid and intentional. \n\nFurthermore, I'll consider the character's facial expression and body language to ensure consistency.

His shoulder would naturally rotate slightly upward, and his elbow would bend at a comfortable angle. The arm could be extended outward, perhaps with his hand open or in a fist, depending on the intended gesture. \n\nFor the answer image, I should ensure that the raised arm looks natural within the context of the boxing ring and the ongoing match in the background.
