The telescope needs to be adjusted slightly to give the impression that it’s aimed at capturing the rare event. Next, the background should evolve from a calm night sky to one filled with a spectacular celestial display. This could involve adding vibrant colors, such as a glowing nebula or a meteor shower, to create a sense of wonder and rarity.

The tower needs to morph into a more egg-like shape, as seen in the ground truth answer image—a rounded stone building with a conical roof resembling an oversized dragon egg. This transformation should retain the stonework texture but alter the overall form to be more organic and less rigid.\n\nTo achieve this, the tower's rectangular structure must be reshaped into a smooth, egg-shaped dome.
