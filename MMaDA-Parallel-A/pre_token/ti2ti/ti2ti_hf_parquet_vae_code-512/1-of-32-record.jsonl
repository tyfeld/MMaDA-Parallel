The rice may absorb some of the soy sauce, turning slightly darker and potentially losing some of its stark white contrast. The seaweed wrapping could become more saturated, enhancing its deep black tone. Additionally, any toppings or fillings exposed to the soy sauce might develop a glossy sheen from the liquid, making them appear wetter and more reflective.\n\nIn the answer image, these effects should be visible.

The loaf should appear significantly smaller and more compact compared to a properly leavened one. The surface might have a less pronounced crust, as the lack of rising action would prevent the formation of large air pockets that typically create a golden-brown, textured crust.
